See [Bioenergetic-Related Gene Expression in the Hippocampus Predicts Internalizing vs. Externalizing Behavior in a F<sub>2</sub> Cross of Selectively-Bred Rats](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.14.500129v4)

The study examined hippocampal gene expression in an F<sub>2</sub> cross of selectively-bred high responder and low responder rats. To complement the differential expression analysis, I mapped cis-eQTLs for the F2 rats and analyzed their colocalization with behavioral QTL to help identify candidates for genes that mediate the influence of genetic variation on behavior.
